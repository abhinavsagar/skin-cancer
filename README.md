## Abstract

In this work, we address the problem of skin cancer classification using convolutional neural networks. A lot of cancer cases early on are misdiagnosed leading to
severe consequences including the death of patient. Also there are cases in which
patients have other problems and doctors interpret it as skin cancer. This leads to
unnecessary time and money spent for further diagnosis. In this work, we address
both of the above problems using deep neural networks and transfer learning architecture. We have used publicly available ISIC databases for both training and
testing our network. Our model achieves an accuracy of 0.935, precision 0.94,
recall 0.77, F1 score 0.85 and ROC- AUC 0.861 which is better than the previous
state of the art approaches.

## Data

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/). This is a binary classification problem. I split the data as shown-

```
dataset train
  benign
   b1.jpg
   b2.jpg
   //
  malignant
   m1.jpg
   m2.jpg
   //  validation
   benign
    b1.jpg
    b2.jpg
    //
   malignant
    m1.jpg
    m2.jpg
    //...
```
